# Editing page text

Each JSON file controls the wording on one page. You can edit these in VS Code or send an edited file back for further changes.

| File                    | Website page             |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `home.json`             | Main landing page        |
| `v2.json`               | Upcoming v2 update       |
| `download.json`         | Downloads                |
| `guide.json`            | Setup guide              |
| `play.json`             | Player guide hub         |

| `community.json`        | Community                |
| `credits.json`          | Credits                  |

## How to change wording

1. Open the JSON for the page you want.
2. Find the wording under `text`. Each group is named after a page section, such as `hero`, `available`, or `achievements`.
3. Change the value inside the quotes, leaving field names, commas, and brackets in place.
4. Save. If `npm run dev` is running, the preview regenerates automatically. Otherwise run `npm run content`, or start the development server.

For example, change `text.hero.intro` in `home.json` to rewrite the landing-page introduction. Change `text.available.heading_1` to rewrite the Available Now heading.

`metadata` controls the browser title and search/share description. `messages` controls text that appears during interactions; preserve placeholders such as `{count}` and `{releases}`. Numbered fields follow the reading order of their section.

Text is treated as plain text, so you do not need HTML. To add a paragraph, rearrange sections, or change a link destination, edit its matching file in `templates/pages/` or ask for a layout change. The renderer reports missing fields instead of silently dropping them.

Navigation and footer wording is included in each page's JSON. Update each page if you want those words changed site-wide. The live download count remains automatic and is not an editable text value. NEBULA's animated wordmark shape is an image asset; changing its accessible title will not redraw the artwork.

Publishing still requires committing and pushing to GitHub. Saving a file only updates the local preview.
